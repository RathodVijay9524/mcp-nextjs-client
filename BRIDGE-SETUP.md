# 🌉 MCP Bridge Setup

## What is the MCP Bridge?
The MCP Bridge allows your deployed web app to access local files and MCP servers by running a local bridge server.

## ✅ Setup Complete!

### 🚀 How to Use:

#### Step 1: Start Bridge Server
```bash
cd mcp-bridge
npm start
```
The bridge server runs on `http://localhost:3001`

#### Step 2: Use Your Apps

**Local Development:**
- Open: `http://localhost:3002` (or your dev port)
- Bridge automatically connects ✅

**Deployed Web App:**
- Open: `https://your-app.vercel.app`
- Bridge automatically connects if server is running ✅

### 🔧 Test Commands:

1. **Project Analysis:**
   ```
   Analyze this project: C:\Users\Admin\mcp-nextjs-client
   ```

2. **Any other project:**
   ```
   Analyze this project: E:\ai_projects\MCP_apps\mcp-host
   ```

### 🎯 How It Works:

- ✅ **Bridge Running**: Real file analysis with actual data
- ❌ **Bridge Offline**: Falls back to demo mode automatically

### 🌐 Bridge Endpoints:

- Health Check: `http://localhost:3001/health`
- Status: `http://localhost:3001/status`
- Operations: `http://localhost:3001/api/mcp/file-operations`

### 🔍 Bridge Server Logs:

When you run analysis, you'll see:
```
🔧 MCP Operation: analyze_project on C:\Users\Admin\mcp-nextjs-client
✅ Project analysis complete: Node.js Project
```

### 📱 Usage Examples:

**Real File Paths (when bridge is running):**
- `Analyze this project: C:\Users\Admin\Documents\MyProject`
- `Analyze this project: E:\Projects\WebApp`
- Any valid Windows path!

**Demo Mode (when bridge is offline):**
- Same commands work but return simulated data
- App shows note: "Start local bridge server for real analysis"

---

## 🎉 Success Indicators:

✅ Bridge server shows `🌉 MCP Bridge Server running`
✅ Web app console shows `🌉 Bridge connection established`  
✅ Project analysis returns real file data with insights
✅ Analysis includes real dependencies from package.json

That's it! Your deployed web app can now access local files through the bridge! 🚀
